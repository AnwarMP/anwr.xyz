## Project Overview

BillBuddy is an AI-powered platform that addresses the critical challenge of health insurance literacy by transforming complex policy documents into clear, actionable insights. The system uses advanced RAG pipelines and prompt engineering to help users understand their healthcare coverage and make informed decisions.

### Key Features

- **Document Analysis**: Intelligent processing of insurance policies
- **Natural Language Q&A**: Context-aware responses to policy questions
- **Vector Search**: Efficient document retrieval using embeddings
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted document handling with AWS S3

## Technical Implementation

### RAG Pipeline Architecture

I built a RAG system using Pinecone and OpenAI:

```typescript
async function getContext(query: string, fileKey: string) {
  // Generate embeddings for the query
  const queryEmbeddings = await getEmbeddings(query);
  
  // Retrieve top matches from Pinecone
  const matches = await getMatchesFromEmbeddings(queryEmbeddings, fileKey);
  
  // Filter matches based on relevance score
  const qualifyingDocs = matches.filter(
    (match) => match.score && match.score > 0.2
  );

  // Extract and format relevant context
  let docs = qualifyingDocs.map(
    (match) => (match.metadata as Metadata).text
  );
  
  return docs.join("\n").substring(0, 3000);
}
```

### Document Processing Pipeline

I implemented a robust document processing system:

```typescript
async function loadS3IntoPinecone(fileKey: string) {
  // Download and process PDF
  const file_name = await downloadFromS3(fileKey);
  const loader = new PDFLoader(file_name);
  const pages = await loader.load();

  // Split documents into manageable chunks
  const documents = await Promise.all(
    pages.map(prepareDocument)
  );

  // Generate and store embeddings
  const vectors = await Promise.all(
    documents.flat().map(embedDocument)
  );

  // Upload to Pinecone with namespace
  const pineconeIndex = await client.index("billbuddy");
  const namespace = pineconeIndex.namespace(
    convertToAscii(fileKey)
  );
  
  await namespace.upsert(vectors);
}
```

### Prompt Engineering

I developed context-aware prompt templates for accurate responses:

```typescript
const basePrompt = {
  role: "system",
  content: `You are an AI assistant specializing in insurance and policy matters. 
    Your traits include:

    1. Professionalism: Maintain courteous and formal tone
    2. Expertise: Deep understanding of insurance terms
    3. Clarity: Explain complex concepts simply
    4. Helpfulness: Provide accurate, actionable advice
    5. Compliance awareness: Knowledge of regulations

    CONTEXT BLOCK:
    ${context}

    Guidelines:
    1. Consider context and user concerns
    2. Avoid assumptions
    3. Emphasize accuracy over comprehensiveness
    4. Suggest cost reduction strategies
    5. Include alternative program information`
};
```

## Technical Architecture

The application follows a modern microservices architecture:

1. **Frontend Layer**
   - Next.js for server-side rendering
   - React components for UI
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Clerk for authentication

2. **Backend Services**
   - Node.js API endpoints
   - PostgreSQL for user data
   - Pinecone for vector storage
   - AWS S3 for document storage

3. **AI Processing Pipeline**
   - OpenAI for embeddings
   - Langchain for RAG orchestration
   - Prompt engineering system
   - Context management

## Infrastructure

```yaml
# Production Infrastructure
