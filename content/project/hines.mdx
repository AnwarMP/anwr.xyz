## A Fresh New Look

When I joined the team at Hines, I saw an opportunity to improve the user experience of the flagship app. The existing design was outdated and the branding was inconsistent but at the same time the app had the potential to be super impactful and was used by hundreds of active users.

I took the initiative to redesign the app from the ground up. I introduced a new design system and a fully fledged UI/UX redesign. The new design was modern, clean and consistent and could be applied to other applications. It was well received by the users and the stakeholders.

Along with this I introduced Figma as a deign tool to the team and trained the team on how to use it. This helped the team to collaborate better and completely changed the way we design and develop applications. It also removed the need for us to hire contractors for design work.

## The Global Data Hub

The global data hub or GDH is our flagship application. It's used by hundreds of users and groups across different company regions and is responsible for outlining the very structure of the companies investment pipeline. All the way from inital project proposal, voting, funding, and closing of the deal. What started as a single CRUD workflow for the real estate investment pipeline has grown into a full fledged data management platform.

Due to the success of our team with this application we were able to expand our team and take on more projects which previously were outsourced (which you will find below).
